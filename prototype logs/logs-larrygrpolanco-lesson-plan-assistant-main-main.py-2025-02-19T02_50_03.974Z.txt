=== Input Parameters ===
{'topic': 'Catching up, Long time no see', 'grade': 7, 'class_duration': '45', 'objectives': 'SWBAT practice catching up with an old friend\nSWBAT practice getting to know a new friend\nSWBAT understand and use common phrases and questions for expressing interest', 'co_teaching_model': 'One teach, one assist', 'classroom_setting': 'English conversation class', 'class_size': 15, 'proficiency_levels': ['Elementary'], 'materials': 'Powerpoint', 'key_vocabulary': '', 'extra_considerations': '', 'assessment_types': []}

=== Refined Objectives ===
### Refined Objectives
- Students will be able to generate and respond to at least 3 conversational questions about personal experiences and interests with 80% accuracy during paired speaking activities
- Students will be able to demonstrate active listening skills by asking follow-up questions and using appropriate conversational gambits when interacting with a partner
- Students will be able to utilize basic social interaction vocabulary and phrases to initiate and maintain a 2-3 minute conversation in English

### Planning Considerations
**Differentiation Opportunities**
Lower-level students can use provided conversation starter cards with pre-written questions, while advanced students can be challenged to create original questions and more complex conversational exchanges. Pair students with mixed proficiency levels to support collaborative learning.

**Co-teaching Integration**
The Lead English Teacher (LET) can model initial conversation structures, while the English Teaching Assistant (ETA) circulates to provide individualized support, demonstrate pronunciation, and offer real-time feedback during speaking activities.

**Cultural Elements**
Incorporate discussion of cultural differences in conversational norms, such as appropriate personal questions, acceptable small talk topics, and non-verbal communication expectations between Taiwanese and Western communication styles.

**Assessment Approaches**
Use a holistic speaking rubric that evaluates conversational skills, including vocabulary use, question formation, listening comprehension, and interactive communication. Conduct both peer assessment (students evaluate each other's conversations) and teacher observation using a structured checklist of target language skills.

=== Input Parameters ===
{'topic': 'Long Time No See, Catching Up', 'grade': 7, 'class_duration': '45', 'objectives': 'SWBAT practice catching up with an old friend\nSWBAT practice getting to know a new friend\nSWBAT use common words and phrases for expressing interest', 'co_teaching_model': 'One teach, one assist', 'classroom_setting': 'English conversation class', 'class_size': 15, 'proficiency_levels': ['Elementary'], 'materials': 'Powerpoint', 'key_vocabulary': '', 'extra_considerations': '', 'assessment_types': []}

=== Refined Objectives ===

- Students will be able to demonstrate active listening skills by asking follow-up questions and showing genuine interest during paired conversational exchanges
- Students will be able to use at least 5 common English phrases for expressing personal interest and maintaining conversational flow

### Planning Considerations
**Differentiation Opportunities**
Lower-level students can use sentence frames and conversation prompt cards, while more advanced students can be challenged to create more complex, nuanced dialogue with additional descriptive language. Pair work can be strategically structured to mix proficiency levels.

**Co-teaching Integration**
The Lead English Teacher (LET) can model initial conversations and provide grammatical guidance, while the English Teaching Assistant (ETA) can focus on pronunciation, natural conversational flow, and providing real-world communication examples. The ETA can also circulate during pair/group activities to provide immediate feedback.

**Cultural Elements**
The lesson provides an opportunity to explore cultural differences in conversational norms, such as appropriate personal questions, body language, and communication styles between Taiwanese and Western communication patterns. Students can discuss and compare social interaction expectations.

**Assessment Approaches**
Informal formative assessment will occur through teacher observation of pair interactions, using a simple rubric tracking conversational skills, vocabulary usage, and engagement. A summative assessment could involve a structured dialogue performance where students demonstrate learned conversational techniques with a partner, evaluated against specific communication criteria.

"To what extent did students demonstrate improved conversational skills and active listening during today's lesson, particularly in their ability to ask follow-up questions and maintain dialogue flow?"

2. Teaching Effectiveness:
"How effectively did the lesson's differentiation strategies support students across varying English proficiency levels, and what modifications might improve future implementation?"

3. Cultural/Language Considerations:
"In what ways did the lesson help students understand culturally appropriate communication strategies, and how might these insights transfer to real-world cross-cultural interactions?"
