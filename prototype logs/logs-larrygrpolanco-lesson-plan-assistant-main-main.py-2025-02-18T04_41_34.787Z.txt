- Students will be able to construct and verbally present 2-3 basic sentence patterns modeled from the picture book narrative, demonstrating comprehension of grammatical structure

### Planning Considerations

**Differentiation Opportunities**
Lower-level students can use word banks and sentence frames, while advanced students can be challenged to create more complex sentences or generate additional vocabulary interpretations. Pair-work can allow peer scaffolding across proficiency levels.

**Co-teaching Integration**
The Lead English Teacher (LET) can manage overall narrative comprehension while the English Teaching Assistant (ETA) provides targeted language support, circulating to offer individualized pronunciation and grammatical guidance during speaking activities.

**Cultural Elements**
Select a picture book that subtly introduces cross-cultural perspectives, allowing students to compare narrative styles, visual storytelling approaches, and linguistic nuances between English and Chinese communication patterns.

**Assessment Approaches**
Implement a multi-modal assessment combining:
- Formative: Real-time observation of student sentence construction
- Summative: Individual student mini-presentations demonstrating vocabulary and sentence pattern mastery
- Peer assessment through structured listening/feedback protocols

This approach provides comprehensive, differentiated learning opportunities aligned with the 7th-grade elementary English proficiency level.
