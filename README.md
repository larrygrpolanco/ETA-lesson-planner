# Fulbright Planner

An AI-powered lesson and workshop planning tool designed specifically for Fulbright participants in Taiwan.

## Project Background

Fulbright Planner was developed to address a specific challenge within the Fulbright Taiwan community. As a Fulbright ETA (English Teaching Assistant) in Taipei, I observed that participants come from diverse backgrounds and work in varied teaching contexts across Taiwan. This diversity meant that standard advice and training materials rarely applied equally to everyone.

This application creates comprehensive lesson plans and workshop outlines tailored to each educator's specific context, whether they are:
- ETAs (English Teaching Assistants)
- EMIs (English as Medium of Instruction advisors)
- ETFs (English Teaching Fellows)

## Development Journey

The project began as a Python/Streamlit prototype that I shared with fellow Fulbrighters. About 50 colleagues tested early versions, providing invaluable feedback that shaped the current design. I analyzed application logs to understand common usage patterns and refined the AI prompts to better match how educators actually use the tool.

The development process followed a user-centered approach:
1. Initial prototype testing
2. Extensive user feedback from the Fulbright Taiwan community
3. Data-driven refinement of AI prompts
4. Multiple iterations based on actual usage patterns
5. Implementation as a responsive single-page web application

## Key Features

- **Dual planning modes:** Create both classroom lesson plans and professional workshop outlines
- **Context-aware planning:** Incorporates Taiwan-specific educational standards and cultural elements
- **Progressive generation:** Builds plans in logical phases
  - Refining educational objectives
  - Designing engaging activities
  - Developing instructional components
  - Producing polished final plans
- **Co-teaching support:** Accommodates various co-teaching models used in Taiwanese schools
- **Modern pedagogical approaches:** Incorporates Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles and differentiation strategies

## Educational Value

Fulbright Planner bridges the gap between educational theory and classroom practice by:
- Aligning with MOE (Ministry of Education) and FSE standards
- Incorporating research-backed pedagogical approaches
- Supporting differentiation for diverse learner needs
- Helping novice teachers develop structured, effective lessons
- Enabling experienced educators to efficiently create standards-aligned plans
- Facilitating cultural exchange through thoughtful integration of Taiwanese cultural elements

The tool saves educators hours of planning time while improving instructional quality, providing a solid foundation that can be further customized to each unique teaching situation.

## Technologies

Built with SvelteKit, Tailwind CSS, and powered by Anthropic's Claude API for AI content generation.
